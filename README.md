This is the $1\rm D$ case, the most simple. The image above shows the evolution of one of the possible $256$ sets of rules with different input arrays containing only $0$'s and $1$'s. The module `elementary.py` contains the class `ElementaryCA` from which any of the $256$ sets can be easily implemented. Examples can be found in `Notebooks/03-Elementary-Cellular-Automaton.ipynb`.
