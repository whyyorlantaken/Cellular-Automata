This is the $1\rm D$ case, the simplest. The image above shows the evolution of one of the possible $256$ sets of rules with different binary input arrays. The module `elementary.py` contains the class `ElementaryCA` from which any of the $256$ sets can be easily implemented. Examples can be found in `Notebooks/03-Elementary-Cellular-Automaton.ipynb`.
